// I had to do a few hacky things to make this view look OK. This is the first time I've done SwiftUI
// inside a UIKit app. I've used UIKit views inside a SwiftUI app a few times (eg mapkit) but I found
// the SwiftUI view did not play happily inside the UIKit navigation view. I couldn't figure out how
// to turn off the UINavigationView so couldn't use SwiftUI NavigationView. For some reason, the UIKit
// one does not provide a background nor does it scale upon scrolling as it would normally.
// To work around the lack of background, I added my own. But had to live with the Navigation title
// provided by UIKit.
// Unfortunately, there was then a further hitch that I've partially worked around. When displaying
// the product detail view modally from the SwiftUI catalogue view, the view lost it's background.
// I've worked around it by adding a view extension that adds a rectangle behind the view. It works
// OK in light mode but looks really bad in dark mode. Would need more work.
