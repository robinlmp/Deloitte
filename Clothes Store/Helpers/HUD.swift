        /// Tried a few things to fix it but failed. My hunch is that because each time `viewOriginalPosition` is run, that it sets based on wherever the frame of the
        /// label is at the time of being triggered. If it is in it's 'base' position, ie after the animation has completed, then the next run works as expected. If it isn't in its base
        /// position though, then the `viewOriginalPosition` gets set incorrectly and the subsequent animation runs with the wrong coordinates.
